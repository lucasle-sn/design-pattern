/**
 * @brief Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family
 * of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects
 * interchangeable.
 *
 * # Problem: Create a navigation app for casual travellers. In the app, a user
 * should be able to enter an address and see the fastest route to that
 * destination displayed on the map. The features include generating the route
 * for: Road, Public Transport, and Walking.
 *
 * # Structure: refers to "strategy_structure.png"
 *
 * # Applicability:
 *  + When using different variants of an algorithm within an object, and be
 * able to switch algorithm during runtime.
 *  + When having similar classes that only differ in some behavior.
 *  + Isolates logic of classesfrom implementation details.
 *  + When context class has a massive conditional statement that switches
 * between variants.
 *
 * # Pros & cons:
 * + Pros:  - can swap algorithm at rum time.
 *          - isolate implementation details from the code that uses it.
 *          - Can replace inheritance with composition.
 *          - align with "Open/closed principle"
 * + Cons:  - do not use when having a couple of algorithms which rarely change.
 *
 * # Note:
 * "Template Method" is based on inheritance. "Strategy" is based on
 * composition.

/**
 * # Implementation:
 *
 * Step 1: The Context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies
 * and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.
 *
 * Step2: The Strategy interface is common to all concrete strategies. It
 * declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.
 *
 * Step 3: Concrete Strategies implement different variations of an algorithm
 * the context uses.
 *
 * Step 4: The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object
 * each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesnâ€™t know what type
 * of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.
 *
 * Step 5: The Client creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the
 * context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy
 * associated with the context at runtime.
